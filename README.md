# GrayscaleGenerator
A useful tool to generate grayscale maps for 3D models based on python. What you only have to do to get the grayscale map is to **input the model file** and **set the output resolution**, **no requiring any dependences**. **taichi** is used in this project in order to speed up the process (The device which you want to use to generate the grayscale map is adjustable). ```trimesh``` ```numpy``` ```taichi``` ```PIL``` ```PyQt5``` modules are used in the project. The GUI part is written using ```PyQt5```. Almost all 3D model file formats are supported, including *.abc, .obj, .ply, .stl, .fbx* **(Non-watertight models are not supported)**.
